=> This code is part of a form validation function that checks whether an email field is correctly filled out.

  1. Checking if the email field is empty:

 * if (!formData.email) 
     {
     errors.email = "Email is required";
     }

     => !formData.email checks if the email field is empty, null, or undefined.

     => If formData.email is empty, an error message "Email is required" is assigned to errors.email.
        Validating the email format:


  * else if (!/\S+@\S+\.\S+/.test(formData.email))
      {
      errors.email = "Email is not valid";
      }

 2. This runs only if the email field is not empty.

    => /\S+@\S+\.\S+/ is a regular expression (RegEx) that checks if the email follows a valid format.

    => .test(formData.email) checks if the email string matches the pattern.

    => If the email does not match the pattern, the error message "Email is not valid" is assigned to errors.email




 Pattern         	Meaning

 \S+	      At least one non-whitespace character before @ (e.g., user)

 @	      The @ symbol must be present

 \S+	      At least one non-whitespace character after @ (e.g., domain)

 \.	      A dot (.) must appear (e.g., .com)

 \S+	      At least one non-whitespace character after the dot (e.g., com)


3. e (Event Object):

    * e is the event object that is automatically passed when an input field changes.
    * e.target refers to the input element that triggered the change.
    * e.target.name gives the name attribute of the input.
    * e.target.value gives the current value of the input.



4. Updating the State (setFormData)

   =>setFormData updates the state formData using the previous state.

   => { ...formData } creates a copy of the existing form data to keep all previous values.

   => [e.target.name]: e.target.value dynamically updates only the field that changed.
