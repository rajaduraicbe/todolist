1. Template literals?
     
      =>  Template strings are a feature in JavaScript (introduced in ES6) that make it easier to work with strings. They are enclosed by           backticks (`) and offer three key benefits:

         *  String Interpolation: Dynamically insert variables or expressions using ${}.
         *  Multi-line Strings: Create strings that span multiple lines without special characters.
         *  Enhanced Readability: Avoid complex concatenations, making code cleaner and more intuitive.

2. Ternary Operator?
      
      => The ternary operator in JavaScript is a shorthand for an if-else statement. It evaluates a condition and returns one value if the          condition is true and another if it is false.

3. Destructuring in Arrays and Objects?

      => Destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into individual          variables in a clean and concise way.

      * Array Destructuring

        => Used to extract values from an array and assign them to variables based on their position.
       
      * Object Destructuring

        => Used to extract properties from an object and assign them to variables based on their keys.

4. Default Parameters?

       => Default parameters allow you to set default values for function arguments in case no value or undefined is provided.
              
            Key Points:

                  * Default parameters work only when the argument is undefined.

                  * They help avoid errors caused by missing function arguments.
